			<h1>Hyper Text Markup Language</h1>
			<h2>What is HTML?</h2>
				<p>Hyper Text Markup Language, This is a mark up language. The basic structure of a webpage is created using HTML markup tags. In a real sense it is not a programming language but a markup language consisting of a combination of a series of markup tags. HTML is most commonly used to create webpages on the Internet and on websites. This file extension can be either .html or .htm. It publishes various formatting, objects and links using different HTML tags. The latest version of HTML is HTML5 whose development work is now complete and new standard.HTML5 has added a new standard for adding audio and video to websites.</p>
			<h2>History</h2>
				<p>In 1960, Tim Berners-Lee, a British computer scientist who was a contractor at CERN, first proposed an emSystem called ENQUIRE prototyped to share documents among CERN researchers. In 1989, Berners-Lee wrote a memo proposing an Internet-based hypertext system. In 1990, Berners-Lee referred to HTML in browser and server software. Earlier this year, Berners-Lee and CERN's information systems engineer Robert Cailliau jointly requested CERN funding for the project, but the project was not formally approved by CERN.</p>
			<h3>Tags</h3>
				<p>Before writing the code, certain words with certain symbols are used. These are called tags.HTML tags are created with Element name and angle bracket . Each language has specific rules for writing. This rule or type is called syntax. There are also specific syntax for writing HTML tags. If you do not write in this way, the browser will not be able to show the content according to the tag.</p>
			<h4>Heading</h4>
				<p>HTML headings are written with tags from h1 to h6. h1 is the largest heading and h6 is the smallest.</p>
			<h5>Paragraph tags</h5>
				<p>To write a paragraph, use p as the start tag and p as the end tag.</p>
			<h6>HTML table</h6>
				<p>The following code is used to create tables in HTML. Four types of tags are used to create tables.
   				 The tr tag is used to write Table Row.
   				 The th tag is used to write Table Header.
    			 The td tag is used to write table data.</p>
